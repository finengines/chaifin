# Status Webhook Server Integration Changes

## Overview

We've implemented a solution to solve the "Chainlit context not found" error by using a shared queue mechanism between the webhook server and the Chainlit application. This approach allows the webhook server to run as a separate service while still being able to display status updates in the Chainlit UI.

## Changes Made

1. **Created `status_webhook_integration.py`**
   - This file contains the FastAPI app for the webhook server
   - It uses a shared queue to communicate with the Chainlit application
   - It includes functions to start the webhook server and get status updates from the queue

2. **Modified `app.py`**
   - Added code to start the webhook server when the Chainlit application starts
   - Added a background task to process status updates from the queue
   - Added code to stop the background task when the chat session ends

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `README.md` to reflect the new approach
   - Updated `README_STATUS_WEBHOOK.md` with the correct endpoint URLs and instructions

4. **Updated Test Scripts**
   - Updated `test_status_webhook.py` to use the correct webhook endpoint
   - Updated `test_webhook_server.py` to use the correct webhook endpoint
   - Updated `n8n_integration_example.py` to use the correct webhook endpoint
   - Updated `n8n_status_webhook_example.json` to use the correct webhook endpoint

## How It Works

1. The webhook server runs as a separate service on port 5679
2. When a status update is received, it's added to a shared queue
3. A background task in the Chainlit application processes the queue and displays the status updates in the UI
4. This approach ensures that status updates are displayed correctly in the Chainlit UI without requiring direct integration with the Chainlit application

## Testing the Integration

1. Start the Chainlit application:
   ```bash
   chainlit run app.py
   ```

2. Send a test status update:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5679/status \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "Testing webhook", "type": "success", "title": "Integration Test"}'
   ```

3. Verify that the status update appears in the Chainlit UI

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Compatibility**: Works with all versions of Chainlit
2. **Reliability**: Status updates are displayed reliably in the Chainlit UI
3. **Simplicity**: No need to modify the Chainlit internals
4. **Separation of Concerns**: The webhook server and Chainlit application are separate but can communicate
5. **Automatic Startup**: The webhook server is automatically started when the Chainlit application starts

## Next Steps

1. Update any n8n workflows to use the new webhook endpoint
2. Test the integration with your existing workflows
3. Consider adding authentication to the webhook endpoint for better security
