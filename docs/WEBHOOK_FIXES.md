# Webhook Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **StyledTaskList.__init__() Error**
   - Problem: The `StyledTaskList.__init__()` method was being called with 3 arguments when it only accepted 1 or 2.
   - Solution: Updated the `StyledTaskList.__init__()` method to accept additional keyword arguments using `**kwargs`.
   - Additional Fix: Fixed how `StyledTaskList` is instantiated in the `on_message` function to use named parameters.

2. **Chainlit Context Not Found Error**
   - Problem: Status updates were being processed outside of a Chainlit context.
   - Solution: Improved error handling in the status update processing to catch and log these errors properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `status_updates.py`
- Updated the `StyledTaskList.__init__()` method to accept additional keyword arguments using `**kwargs`.
- Modified the `add_task` method to return the created task object, allowing it to be referenced later.
- This ensures that the class can handle any additional parameters passed to it without causing errors.

### 2. Improved Error Handling in `app.py`
- Added a try-except block around the entire status update processing loop.
- Added more detailed error logging with stack traces.
- Added a fallback mechanism to display error messages in the UI when possible.

### 3. Fixed Task List Usage in `app.py`
- Updated how `StyledTaskList` is instantiated to use named parameters: `StyledTaskList(title="Processing Request")`.
- Changed the task creation and update flow to match the API of the `StyledTaskList` class.
- Removed references to `task_list.status` and `task_list.send()` which were causing errors.

### 4. Enhanced `status_webhook_integration.py`
- Added more detailed error logging with stack traces.
- Improved error handling in the webhook server startup process.
- Added error handling for queue operations.

### 5. Updated Test Scripts
- Enhanced `test_integrated_webhook.py` with better logging and error handling.
- Created a new diagnostic script `diagnose_webhook.py` to help identify issues.
- Added a specialized diagnostic script `diagnose_task_list.py` to test the `StyledTaskList` class.

## Diagnostic Tools

### New Diagnostic Script: `diagnose_webhook.py`
This script helps diagnose issues with the webhook integration by:
- Checking if required modules can be imported
- Inspecting the `StyledTaskList` class to verify its signature
- Checking if the webhook server is running
- Sending a test status update
- Verifying that required files exist and are up-to-date

### New Diagnostic Script: `diagnose_task_list.py`
This script specifically tests the `StyledTaskList` class to ensure it works correctly:
- Checks the method signatures
- Tests creating a task list
- Tests adding and updating tasks
- Verifies that the `add_task` method returns a task object

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Start the Chainlit application:
   ```bash
   chainlit run app.py
   ```

2. Run the diagnostic scripts:
   ```bash
   python diagnose_webhook.py
   python diagnose_task_list.py
   ```

3. If the diagnostic scripts pass all checks, run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test_integrated_webhook.py
   ```

4. Check the Chainlit UI to verify that the status updates are displayed correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the Chainlit application logs for detailed error messages.
2. Run the diagnostic scripts to identify any configuration issues.
3. Verify that all required dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
4. Ensure that the Chainlit application is running before sending status updates.
5. Check that the webhook server is running on port 5679 (use the health check endpoint: `http://localhost:5679/health`).

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding authentication to the webhook endpoint for better security.
2. Implement persistent storage for status updates to prevent loss during server restarts.
3. Add more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.
4. Create a UI dashboard for monitoring status updates.

# Status Webhook Integration Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to fix the "Chainlit context not found" error and improve the status webhook integration. The primary issue was that the webhook server was running in a separate process/thread and didn't have access to the Chainlit context, which is required to send messages to the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `status_webhook_integration.py`

- Changed the status queue from a `queue.Queue()` to a simple Python list for easier access across modules
- Added a `WEBHOOK_SERVER_RUNNING` flag to track the server's status
- Improved the health check endpoint to provide more information
- Enhanced error handling for JSON decoding and general exceptions
- Simplified the `get_next_status_update()` function to work with the list-based queue
- Added a more robust `clear_queue()` function
- Improved logging throughout the file

### 2. Updated `app.py`

- Enhanced the `process_status_updates()` function with better error handling
- Added clearing of the queue at startup to prevent processing old updates
- Improved logging for better debugging
- Separated message creation and sending for better error handling
- Added support for different types of status updates with appropriate message types
- Removed the attempt to send error messages when processing fails (which could cause additional errors)
- Added more detailed logging for successful status updates

## How It Works

1. The webhook server runs on port 5679 and receives status updates via HTTP POST requests to `/status`
2. When a status update is received, it's added to the `STATUS_QUEUE` list
3. The Chainlit application runs a background task that periodically checks this queue for new updates
4. When an update is found, it's processed within the Chainlit context and displayed in the UI
5. The queue-based approach ensures that updates are processed in the correct context, avoiding the "Chainlit context not found" error

## Testing the Integration

To test the integration:

1. Start the Chainlit application:
   ```
   chainlit run app.py
   ```

2. Send a test status update using the `test_status_webhook.py` script:
   ```
   python test_status_webhook.py --demo
   ```

3. Verify that the status updates appear in the Chainlit UI

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify that the webhook server is running by accessing `http://localhost:5679/health`
3. Make sure the Chainlit application is running and processing status updates
4. Check that the status updates are being added to the queue correctly

## Common Status Update Types

The system supports various types of status updates:

- `progress`: Shows a progress bar with percentage
- `success`: Displays a success message
- `warning`: Displays a warning message
- `error`: Displays an error message
- `info`: Displays an informational message
- `toast`: Shows a temporary toast notification
- Custom types: Displayed using a custom element

## Example Usage

```python
import requests

# Send a progress update
requests.post("http://localhost:5679/status", json={
    "type": "progress",
    "title": "Processing Data",
    "content": "Processing data... 50% complete",
    "progress": 50
})

# Send a success message
requests.post("http://localhost:5679/status", json={
    "type": "success",
    "title": "Task Completed",
    "content": "The task has been completed successfully!"
})

# Send a toast notification
requests.post("http://localhost:5679/status", json={
    "type": "toast",
    "content": "This is a toast notification",
    "duration": 5000  # 5 seconds
})
```

## Next Steps

- Consider adding authentication to the webhook server for improved security
- Implement persistent storage for status updates if needed
- Add more advanced notification types as required
- Create a UI dashboard for monitoring status updates

## Latest Fixes (2025-03-05)

### 1. Fixed "Chainlit context not found" Error

The "Chainlit context not found" error was occurring because the webhook server was running in a separate thread/process and didn't have access to the Chainlit context when it tried to process status updates directly. We've made the following changes to fix this issue:

- Modified the webhook server to only add status updates to a queue and not try to process them directly
- Improved the background task in the Chainlit application to process status updates from the queue within the Chainlit context
- Enhanced error handling to catch and log errors properly without trying to send error messages that would also fail
- Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### 2. Removed Unwanted Task Lists for Normal Message Sending

We've removed the task lists that were appearing for normal message sending, which were not needed. Instead, we've implemented a simpler approach:

- Replaced the `StyledTaskList` with a simple "Thinking..." message that appears while the request is being processed
- Removed the task list creation and updating code from the `on_message` function
- Simplified the response processing code to focus on displaying the actual response content

### 3. Added New Test Script for Diagnosing Webhook Issues

We've created a new test script (`test_webhook_context.py`) to help diagnose and fix webhook-related issues:

- The script can check if the webhook server is running and healthy
- It can send various types of status updates to test if they're being processed correctly
- It provides detailed logging to help identify where issues might be occurring

## How to Test the Latest Fixes

1. Start the Chainlit application:
   ```bash
   chainlit run app.py
   ```

2. Run the new test script to verify the webhook server is working:
   ```bash
   python test_webhook_context.py
   ```

3. If you want to test specific types of status updates, you can use the following commands:
   ```bash
   python test_webhook_context.py --info     # Test info status update
   python test_webhook_context.py --progress # Test progress status update
   python test_webhook_context.py --toast    # Test toast notification
   python test_webhook_context.py --success  # Test success status update
   python test_webhook_context.py --warning  # Test warning status update
   python test_webhook_context.py --error    # Test error status update
   ```

4. Check the Chainlit UI to verify that the status updates are displayed correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the logs for error messages (both the Chainlit application logs and the webhook server logs)
2. Verify that the webhook server is running by accessing `http://localhost:5679/health` in your browser
3. Make sure the Chainlit application is running and processing status updates
4. Try restarting the Chainlit application to ensure the webhook server is started correctly
5. Use the `test_webhook_context.py` script to diagnose specific issues

If the "Chainlit context not found" error persists, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The webhook server is trying to access the Chainlit context directly (which it shouldn't)
2. The background task for processing status updates is not running
3. There's an issue with the queue mechanism for passing status updates between the webhook server and the Chainlit application

In these cases, check the logs for more specific error messages and use the `test_webhook_context.py` script to help diagnose the issue.
